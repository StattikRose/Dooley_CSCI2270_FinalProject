#Dooley_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary
	This program will compare the runtime for many sorting algorithms on a random sized set (20-1000) of random numbers (0-999). The Program will then inform the user of size of the data set and print the runtimes. Included sorting algorithms:
		1. Insertion sort
		2. Selection sort
		3. Merge sort
		4. Heap sort
		5. Quick sort
		6. Bubble sort
		7. Tree Sort
		8. Shell Sort
		
How to Run
	1. Download sortingAlgs.h, sortingAlgs.cpp and sortingAlgsTester.cpp
	2. Compile in terminal by navigating to the folder then using the command:
		 g++ -std=c++11 sortingAlgs.cpp sortingAlgsTester.cpp
	3. Run the program using the command:
		./a.out

Dependencies

System Requirements
	Program should work on OSX, Linux and Windows.

Open issues/bugs
	- Merge sort still needs to be written (I left this one for someone to write as contribution to my project)
