# Dooley_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary
	This program will compare the runtime for many sorting algorithms on a user entered set of integer values. The program will prompt the user for some data then the user will be presented with a menu so they can choose to run a single algorithm and get the runtime or to run them all and compare the runtime. Included sorting algorithms:
		1. Insertion sort
		2. Selection sort
		3. Merge sort
		4. Heap sort
		5. Quick sort
		6. Bubble sort
		7. Shell sort
		8. Comb sort
		9. Counting sort
		10. Bucket sort
		11. Radix sort
